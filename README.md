# permutations
Generate all permutations from set of characters
# How it works
We enumerate all strings of a given length, l, by "counting" up by 1 each time. Except that instead of using numbers, the characters from the provided set of characters serve as the "numbers". For example, the set of characters, "abcde" would be the equivalent of having a base 5 numbering system, such that all strings of a given length can be generated by counting up by 1, up to 5 ^ l, in this system. The "numbers" are then padded from left to right in order to reach length l (ie, when generating length 3 strings, the string representing the number  "2" (ie "c" in our example) would be padded to aab).

The process is then repeated for generating all strings from length 1 to l, inclusive.
